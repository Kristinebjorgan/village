# **DUGNAD**
*The strenght found in shared efforts*

Overview
The word "dugnad" originates from the Old Norse dugnad̄r, meaning "help" or "support".
Dugnad is a digital platform rooted in the Norwegian spirit of community—where individuals come together to help, uplift, and share their strengths. This platform bridges skills, time, and support without monetary exchange, fostering genuine connections and collaboration.

Core Values
* Connection: Dugnad connects people through collaboration, building skills and friendships.
* Trust: Everyone has something valuable to offer; each act of help strengthens the community.
* Empowerment: Users give and receive support in a meaningful way.
* Inclusiveness: Dugnad is open to everyone—no contribution is too small.

Features
Create and Post Listings: Offer skills, services, or time to your community.
Bid Using Dugnad Credits: A currency-free exchange system that rewards participation.

Future Updates:
Adding functionality for users to request help directly.
Support for non-auction items to encourage broader sharing.
